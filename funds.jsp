					<p class="card-text paragraphf text-dark"align="justify"><font color="black">
					Debt funds are mutual funds that invest in fixed income securities like bonds and treasury bills. Gilt fund, monthly income plans (MIPs), short term plans (STPs), liquid funds, and fixed maturity plans (FMPs),short term, medium term and long term bonds.The fundamental reason for investing in debt funds is to earn interest income and capital appreciation. The issuer pre-decides the interest rate you will receive as well as the maturity period. Hence, they are also known as ‘fixed-income’ securities. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds.Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns.Debt funds can offer only moderate returns, while equity funds, which are highly risky, offer high returns over longer time horizon.
